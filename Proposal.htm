<h1> Project Proposal </h1>
</head>

<body>

<p> <u>What is your website about?</u> <br> My website is going to be a showcase of photographs I have taken during my trips.</p>
<p><u>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?) </u> <br> My website is important because as self-taught photographer, I want to show people that photography doesn't always need the best equipment. More than anything, the angle makes up 90% of the shot. </p>
<p> <u>Who is your target audience set? </u><br> Target audience are other amateur photographers or admirers of simple photography.</p>
<p><u> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? </u><br> I plan to include a homepage with a three button navigation system (subject to change of course). The three buttons will be my photographs, where I input a map where I then tag another page to certain areas of the map where I have taken pictures on those pages. My second button will be a site map where you can go to any page on the webpage from there.And then finally, a contact me pages for future questions from my target audience. </p>
