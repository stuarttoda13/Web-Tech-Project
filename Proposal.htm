<p><u>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?) </u> <br>My website is important because JS Park is an important figure both on and off the field. On the field he is known for his clutch goals in games that mattered and off the pitch he is considered an ambassador for asians trying to make it into the soccer world. </p>
